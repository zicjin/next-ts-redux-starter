# TypeScript React Starter

This quick start guide will teach you how to wire up TypeScript with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).
By the end, you'll have

* a project with React and TypeScript
* linting with [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint)
* testing with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/), and
* state management with [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)

We'll use the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool to quickly get set up.

We assume that you're already using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
You may also want to get a sense of [the basics with React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html).
